# nano-kanban

A tiny shared task board for AI agents. One process, one file, one URL.

`nano-kanban` is **just task orchestration** — a shared blackboard where multiple agents can claim tasks, comment for reviewers, and mark them done. It does not spawn agents, plan work, or manage workflows. For those things, _let go and let claude_. This is just the piece you drop in to enable two or more agents to coordinate on a list of tasks.

- **MCP server** over streamable HTTP, so any agent that speaks MCP can use it.
- **Live dashboard** at the same URL for a human to watch the board.
- **One JSON file** (`./tasks.json`) as state. Per-cwd, per-session.
- **Zero config.** One command, done.

## Install

From GitHub — latest on `main`:

```bash
pnpm add -g github:rewdy/nano-kanban
# or
npm install -g github:rewdy/nano-kanban
```

Or pin to a released tag for stability:

```bash
pnpm add -g github:rewdy/nano-kanban#v0.1.0
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.

## Usage

Run inside the project directory where you want `tasks.json` to live:

```bash
nano-kanban serve
```

You'll see:

```
nano-kanban listening on http://127.0.0.1:7777
  Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:7777/
  MCP URL:   http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp
  State:     /path/to/project/tasks.json
```

Open the dashboard in a browser to watch. Point your agent at the MCP URL.

### Options

```
nano-kanban serve [--port 7777] [--file ./tasks.json]
```

### Wiring into Claude Code

Add the MCP server to your Claude Code config:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http nano-kanban http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp
```

Then in a Claude Code session, the agent can call `list_tasks`, `claim_task`, etc. The agent should pass a stable `agent_id` string (e.g. `"claude-main"`) on claim/complete/release so the board knows who owns what.

| `unblock_task`  | Remove specific blocker ids                                                 | —                                                                       |
| `request_human` | Flag the task as needing human input (stays in column, flares on dashboard) | —                                                                       |

### Error shape

Errors an agent might want to branch on are returned as `{ isError: true, structuredContent: { code, ... } }` rather than thrown. For example:

```json
{ "isError": true, "structuredContent": { "code": "already_claimed", "claimed_by": "claude-main" } }
```

`already_claimed` is a cue to pick the next task. `not_found`, `wrong_status`, `blocked`, and `not_assignee` usually indicate the agent should surface the problem.

## Dashboard

Three columns: Todo, In Progress, Done. Each card shows title, short id, assignee, comment count, and blocker count. Click the `💬` badge on any card to expand the comment thread.

Tasks flagged with `needs_human` get a prominent orange flare and pin to the top of their column, with the reason shown inline.

Theme switcher in the top-right: System (follows OS), Light, or Dark. Choice persists to `localStorage`.

## Security model

nano-kanban binds `127.0.0.1` only and rejects MCP requests whose `Host`/`Origin` header isn't localhost. There is no auth — the localhost boundary is the security boundary. Don't expose the daemon beyond localhost.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm test         # node:test suite for the store
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm build        # emit dist/
```
